- Documentation completeness
- Testing coverage
- Adherence to standards
- Community value

## Quality Guidelines

### Writing Effective Skills

**Concise is Key**: The context window is shared. Only include what Claude doesn't already know.

**Imperative Form**: Use command form in instructions
- ✅ "Run the security scan"
- ❌ "You should run the security scan"

**Progressive Disclosure**: Organize content using progressive disclosure patterns (see [Progressive Disclosure](#progressive-disclosure) below)

**Security-First**:
- Document sensitive data handling
- Specify required permissions
- Include audit logging guidance
- Note compliance requirements

### Security Considerations

All skills must address:

1. **Sensitive Data**: How to handle secrets, credentials, PII
2. **Access Control**: Required permissions and authorization
3. **Audit Logging**: What should be logged for compliance
4. **Compliance**: Relevant standards (SOC2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
5. **Safe Defaults**: Secure-by-default configurations

## Progressive Disclosure

Progressive disclosure is critical for managing Claude's context window efficiently. The context is shared across system prompts, conversation history, active skills, and user requests.

### The 500-Line Rule

**Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines**. When content exceeds this limit, move detailed information to `references/` and link to it from SKILL.md.

**Challenge every piece of information**: Ask "Does Claude really need this explanation?" Claude is already very smart - only include what Claude doesn't already know.

### Three Progressive Disclosure Patterns

#### Pattern 1: High-Level Guide with References

SKILL.md contains core workflows and common patterns. Detailed content lives in references.

**SKILL.md** (150 lines):
```markdown
## Core Workflow

1. Run initial scan
2. Analyze results
3. Generate report

For detailed configuration options, see [references/advanced-config.md](references/advanced-config.md)
For framework mappings, see [references/owasp-mappings.md](references/owasp-mappings.md)
```

**references/advanced-config.md** (300 lines):
- Entropy detection settings
- Custom rule patterns
- Allowlist configuration
- Performance tuning

#### Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Organization

When a skill covers multiple domains (e.g., multiple languages or frameworks), create separate reference files per domain.

**SKILL.md** (200 lines):
```markdown
## Language Support

Semgrep supports multiple languages. For language-specific patterns:
- [references/python-patterns.md](references/python-patterns.md)
- [references/javascript-patterns.md](references/javascript-patterns.md)
- [references/java-patterns.md](references/java-patterns.md)
```

#### Pattern 3: Conditional Details

Provide basic content inline, with links to advanced topics for expert users.

**SKILL.md** (250 lines):
```markdown
## Basic Scanning

Run a basic scan:
```bash
semgrep --config=auto .
```

**Advanced users**: For custom rulesets and CI/CD integration patterns, see [references/advanced-usage.md](references/advanced-usage.md)
```

### Reference File Organization

**For references >100 lines**: Include a table of contents at the top

```markdown
# Advanced Configuration Guide

## Table of Contents
- [Entropy Detection](#entropy-detection)
- [Custom Rules](#custom-rules)
- [Performance Tuning](#performance-tuning)
```

**Keep references one level deep**: Don't create nested reference structures. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.

❌ **Don't do**: SKILL.md → references/index.md → references/sub/details.md
✅ **Do**: SKILL.md → references/details.md

### When to Split Content

**Move to references/** when:
- Content exceeds 100 lines
- Details are framework-specific (detailed OWASP/CWE mappings)
- Information is for advanced users only
- Content is lookup-oriented (rule libraries, configuration options)

**Keep in SKILL.md** when:
- Core workflows everyone needs
- Decision points and conditional logic
- Common patterns (top 3-5 use cases)
- Quick start guidance

## Workflow Patterns

Workflows help Claude execute complex operations systematically. Break operations into clear, sequential steps.

### Workflow Checklist Pattern

Provide checkable checklists that Claude can copy and track progress:

```markdown
## Security Assessment Workflow

Research Progress:
[ ] 1. Identify application entry points
[ ] 2. Map authentication and authorization flows
[ ] 3. Identify data flows and sensitive data handling
[ ] 4. Review security controls
[ ] 5. Document findings with framework references
[ ] 6. Generate report with remediation priorities

Work through each step systematically. Check off completed items.
```

**Benefits**:
- Provides clear progress tracking
- Ensures no steps are skipped
- Works for both code-based and analysis tasks
- User can see what's completed and what's remaining

### Conditional Workflow Pattern

Guide Claude through decision points:

```markdown
## Vulnerability Remediation Workflow

1. Identify vulnerability type
   - If SQL injection → See [references/sqli-remediation.md](references/sqli-remediation.md)
   - If XSS → See [references/xss-remediation.md](references/xss-remediation.md)
   - If authentication flaw → See [references/auth-remediation.md](references/auth-remediation.md)

2. Assess severity (CVSS score)
   - If CVSS >= 7.0 → Priority: Critical
   - If CVSS 4.0-6.9 → Priority: High
   - If CVSS < 4.0 → Priority: Medium

3. Apply remediation pattern
4. Validate fix
5. Document changes
```

### Iterative Workflow Pattern

For operations requiring multiple iterations:

```markdown
## Code Security Review Workflow

For each file in scope:
1. Identify security-sensitive operations
2. Check against secure coding patterns
3. Flag potential vulnerabilities
4. Document finding with CWE reference
5. Suggest remediation

Continue until all files reviewed.
```

## Feedback Loops

Feedback loops dramatically improve output quality by enabling iterative refinement.

### The Validation Loop Pattern

**Run validator → Fix errors → Repeat**

```markdown
## Secure Configuration Validation

1. Generate security configuration
2. Run validation script: `./scripts/validate_config.py config.yaml`
3. Review validation output for errors and warnings
4. Fix identified issues
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until validation passes
6. Apply configuration
```

### Code Validation Example

For skills that generate code:

```markdown
## Secure Code Generation Workflow

1. Generate secure code implementation
2. Run security linters:
   ```bash
   bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
   semgrep --config=auto . --json
   ```
3. Review findings
4. Fix any security issues identified
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no issues found
6. Run tests to verify functionality
```

### Configuration Validation Example

For skills that generate configurations:

```markdown
## CI/CD Security Configuration

1. Generate pipeline security configuration
2. Validate with validation script
3. Check for:
   - Secrets not in environment variables
   - Excessive permissions
   - Missing security scanning steps
   - Insecure dependencies
4. Fix issues and re-validate
5. Apply configuration once validation passes
```

**Benefits of feedback loops**:
- Catches errors early
- Improves quality systematically
- Reduces manual review burden
- Provides objective success criteria

## Evaluation & Testing

Create evaluations BEFORE extensive documentation. This evaluation-first approach identifies gaps and ensures skills work as intended.

### Evaluation-First Development Process

1. **Identify skill requirements**: What should the skill accomplish?
2. **Create test scenarios**: 3-5 realistic security scenarios
3. **Establish baseline**: Test current skill (or no skill) performance
4. **Write minimal instructions**: Just enough to pass evaluations
5. **Iterate**: Observe behavior, refine instructions, re-test

### Creating Test Scenarios

**Good test scenarios are**:
- **Realistic**: Based on actual security operations
- **Specific**: Clear inputs and expected outputs
- **Measurable**: Objective success criteria
- **Diverse**: Cover common patterns and edge cases

**Example test scenarios for SAST skill**:

```markdown
## Test Scenario 1: SQL Injection Detection
- Input: Python Flask app with SQL injection vulnerability
- Expected: Identify vulnerability, provide CWE-89 reference, suggest parameterized queries
- Success: Finding includes severity, OWASP reference, and code fix

## Test Scenario 2: XSS in React Component
- Input: React component with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Expected: Flag XSS risk (CWE-79), suggest DOMPurify or safer alternatives
- Success: Finding references OWASP A03:2021, provides secure example

## Test Scenario 3: Insecure Deserialization
- Input: Java code using ObjectInputStream with untrusted data
- Expected: Identify CWE-502, explain risks, suggest safer serialization
- Success: References MITRE ATT&CK T1027, provides remediation steps
```

### Testing Across Models

Test skills with multiple Claude models:
- **Haiku**: Fast, cost-effective operations
- **Sonnet**: Balanced performance for most tasks
- **Opus**: Complex analysis requiring deep reasoning

Different models may need different levels of detail. Aim for instructions that work well across all models.

### Iterative Development with Claude

**Claude A (Expert)**: Helps you refine the skill
**Claude B (Agent)**: Uses the skill to perform work

1. Ask Claude A to review and improve skill documentation
2. Test skill with Claude B on real scenarios
3. Observe Claude B's behavior and identify gaps
4. Return to Claude A with observations for improvements
5. Repeat until skill performs reliably

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submission, test your skill:

- [ ] Runs successfully on 3-5 realistic scenarios
- [ ] All bundled scripts execute without errors
- [ ] References are accessible and load correctly
- [ ] No placeholder text (TODO, FIXME)
- [ ] Workflows complete end-to-end
- [ ] Error conditions handled gracefully
- [ ] Security considerations documented
- [ ] Validation passes: `./scripts/validate_skill.py skills/<category>/<skill-name>`

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes when creating skills:

### Content Anti-Patterns

❌ **Excessive verbosity**: Explaining concepts Claude already knows
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
Git is a version control system used by developers to track changes...

<!-- DO -->
Scan git history for exposed secrets using Gitleaks
```

❌ **Time-sensitive information**: Dates that will become outdated
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
As of 2024, the OWASP Top 10 includes...

<!-- DO -->
Map findings to current OWASP Top 10 categories
```

❌ **Windows-style paths**: Always use forward slashes
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
scripts\validate_config.py

<!-- DO -->
scripts/validate_config.py
```

### Structural Anti-Patterns

❌ **Deeply nested references**: Keep references one level from SKILL.md
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
SKILL.md → references/index.md → references/advanced/details.md

<!-- DO -->
SKILL.md → references/advanced-details.md
```

❌ **Auxiliary files**: Don't create extra documentation files
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
README.md, CHANGELOG.md, INSTALLATION.md

<!-- DO -->
Only SKILL.md for documentation
```

❌ **Exceeding line limits**: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
SKILL.md with 700 lines of content

<!-- DO -->
SKILL.md (350 lines) + references/advanced-topics.md (350 lines)
```

### Workflow Anti-Patterns

❌ **Offering too many options**: Provide default with escape hatch
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
Choose one of these 8 scanning approaches...

<!-- DO -->
Run standard scan with: semgrep --config=auto .
For custom configurations, see references/custom-scans.md
```

❌ **Vague workflows**: Be specific about steps
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
1. Analyze the code
2. Fix issues
3. Done

<!-- DO -->
1. Run SAST scan: semgrep --config=auto . --json
2. Review findings with CVSS >= 7.0
3. For each critical finding:
   - Identify root cause
   - Apply remediation pattern from references/
   - Validate fix with re-scan
4. Generate report with remaining findings
```

❌ **Punting to Claude**: Handle deterministic operations in scripts
```markdown
<!-- DON'T -->
"Parse the JSON output and extract CVE IDs"

<!-- DO -->
Run: ./scripts/extract_cves.py scan-results.json
```

### Degrees of Freedom

Match instruction strictness to operation fragility:

**High Freedom** (text instructions): Multiple valid approaches
- "Analyze the codebase for security anti-patterns"
- "Provide recommendations based on OWASP guidelines"

**Medium Freedom** (pseudocode with parameters): Preferred pattern with variation
- "Run semgrep with --config=auto, review findings, prioritize by severity"
- "Generate threat model covering STRIDE categories"

**Low Freedom** (specific scripts): Operations are fragile, consistency critical
- "Run: ./scripts/validate_policy.py policy.json"
- "Execute: docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src returntocorp/semgrep:latest"

**Use scripts for low-freedom operations** to ensure reliability and consistency.
